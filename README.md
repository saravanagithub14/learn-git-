# 🌟 Randomo Project

Welcome to **Randomo** – a quirky, experimental project designed to showcase random things that do random stuff... randomly.

## 🚀 About the Project

Randomo is a fun, modular, and totally unpredictable project built for the curious-minded. Whether you're testing out new frameworks, playing with APIs, or just seeing what happens when you press "Run", Randomo is your go-to sandbox.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10  
- Flask (for the backend)  
- React (for the frontend)  
- SQLite (for light-weight storage)  
- OpenAI API (for random magic ✨)  
- Docker (because why not?)  

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/randomo.git
cd randomo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🧪 Usage

Once everything is set up, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and let the randomness begin!

### Example Features:
- Generates random quotes and facts
- Random background themes every visit
- AI-generated fortunes (no refunds)

## 📦 Docker Support

You can run the whole thing in a container if you want:

```bash

```
